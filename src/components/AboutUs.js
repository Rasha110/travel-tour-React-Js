      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2016, Trippy began as a small travel startup in Lahore,
        Pakistan, with the goal of making travel planning more seamless and
        exciting for everyone. The company was started by three university
        friends who were passionate about exploring the world and helping others
        do the same. Initially offering only domestic tour packages, Trippy
        gained popularity for its personalized service, budget-friendly deals,
        and hassle-free booking experience.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        comfort, and confidence by delivering exceptional travel experiences
        through personalized service, innovation, and trusted partnerships.
